<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi my name is Om Prakash and I am very new to this IT field. Currently I am
  doing an internship at Stylopay.
</p>

<p>
  This is a new phase in my life and I am feeling very anxious about this new
  change.
</p>

<p>
  Not getting any specific time for myself. Trying to follow a discipline for an
  healthy and productive life.
</p>
<p>
  Although there is not that much of the work pressure still I am feeling that
  and I belive giving atleast 1-2 hours extra to my learning apart from office
  will neither burn me out nor would affect me as a person. Worst could happen
  is that they will remove me. I am doing my best to perform optimally still if
  there is some chance then that may be good for me.
</p>
